Prerequisites for Network as Code  

# NOW ARCHIVED
The setup part has been anbandoned in favour of some Python scripts under https://github.com/peetvandesande/aws-nac

The ipam part has been moved to its own repository: https://github.com/peetvandesande/phpipam-docker

I'm only keeping the repository so I can look back at how to do some things in Ansible but at some point this whole repo will be binned.


# Software required
- Docker
- Terraform
- Ansible

# Description
This repository does the following:
- deploys containers to run an IP address management tool (phpipam)
- uses Ansible to set up the basics in IPAM
